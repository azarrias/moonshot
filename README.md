# Zoom to the Moon

Horizontally scrolling shooter video game made by **1916 Underdogs** for the **Game Off 2020** game jam, hosted by Github.
The jam theme was **_Moonshot_**.

## Backstory

Year 2678.

It has been a couple hundred years since humanity started populating settlements on the Moon.
We live in the era of space exploration and development.

The excitement in the space and aeronautics communities hit its peak when the _Ulnods_, an alien species first contacted us.
Soon enough we found out that their intentions were not so kind, and after a few failed attempts by diplomats trying to reach an understanding, the Ulnods began the hostilities.

First they attacked and destroyed the Moon, and now they are coming for the Earth.

This crisis calls for desperate measures. 
You must reach the Moon remains asap, help the surviving to get away in one piece, and destroy all hostiles on your way there.

We trust you with this huge responsibility, _SR Comet_.

All our hopes are on you.
